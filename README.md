# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? .
     Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.Easy to Learn. One of the most significant features of Python is that it is very easy to learn. ...

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
     Step 1: Check Your System. ...
Step 2: Download Python. ...
Step 3: Choose the Right Version. ...
Step 4: Download the Installer. ...
Step 5: Run the Installer. ...
Step 6: Verify the Installation. ...
Step 7: Install a Code Editor (Optional) ...
Step 8: Write Your First Python Code.
Install Python.
Install Pip.
Install VirtualEnv.
Install VirtualEnvWrapper-win.
3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
The print() Function: We use the built-in Python method print() to show text or other objects on the terminal. For example, to display the string- Hello, World!, we use syntax- print("Hello, World!"). The String: Because "Hello, World!" is surrounded by double quotes, Python treats it as a string
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
For instance, Python has several built-in data types, including numeric types (int, float, complex), string (str), boolean (bool), and collection types (list, tuple, dict, set).14 Jun 2024
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
    Loops and conditional statements are powerful constructs that allow programmers to automate repetitive tasks and control the flow of their programs based on certain conditions. In this article, we explored for loops, while loops, if statements, and if-else statements in Python with examples.age = 18 if age >= 18: print('You are eligible to vote. ') else: print('You are not eligible to vote. ') # Output: # 'You are eligible to vote.
6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
     In Python programming, functions are essential building blocks that allow us to organize and reuse code efficiently. Functions provide a way to encapsulate a set of instructions, perform specific tasks, and return results.You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task.def add_two_num(a,b):
sum=a+b;
num1=int(input("Input the first number : "))
num2=int(input("Input the second number :"))
print("The sum of given two numbers is",add_two_num(num1.
7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
The difference between list and dictionary in Python lies in their structure; while a list is an ordered collection indexed by position and allowing duplicates, a dictionary is an unordered collection of unique key pairs.Create an empty list to store the converted list of lists. Iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary using a loop, or a list comprehension. For each key-value pair, create a new list that consists of the key followed by the list of values. Append the new list to the list of lists.
8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Python's exception handling consists of five keywords: "try," "except," "else," "finally," and "raise," each used to manage different aspects of error handling processes.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f713ec4-df0d-4722-a848-943a785f1040)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f397035-327a-494e-8652-56251f90a0b7)


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
In Python, both modules and packages organize and structure the code but serve different purposes. In simple terms, a module is a single file containing Python code, whereas a package is a collection of modules that are organized in a directory hierarchy.# Python program to show how to use the sin(), cos(), tan() function.
# importing the math module.
import math.
angle = math.pi / 4.
# returning the sine of pi/4.
print( "The sine of pi/4 is : ", math.sin( angle ) )
# returning the cosine of pi/4.
print( "The cosine of pi/4 is : ", math.cos( angle ) )
10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    Read Only ('r'): This mode opens the text files for reading only. ...
Read and Write ('r+'): This method opens the file for both reading and writing. ...
Write Only ('w'): This mode opens the file for writing only. ...
Write and Read ('w+'): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing.
o read a file in Python, we employ the built-in open() function, followed by the read() method. In this instance, 'example. txt' is the name of the file we wish to read, and 'r' is the mode in which we open the file. The 'r' mode signifies 'read', indicating that we're opening the file intending to read its content.
